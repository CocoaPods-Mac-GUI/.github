Its intuitive design integrates seamlessly with your development environment, offering features like project scanning, dependency tree visualization, and one-click pod installation.

Optimized for performance on **macOS Ventura and Sonoma**, it runs flawlessly on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Whether you are a beginner looking to simplify your workflow or an experienced developer managing large-scale projects, CocoaPods Mac GUI enhances productivity and reduces setup time.
